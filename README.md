# Solar-Sys-LPMF
Just a simple use of JS that i did at school. Possible problems may occurs.

Special Thanks for www.shadedrelief.com for their amazing earth's textures. 

M.GIGARD for the code idea and few code itself. It was his project i took as a solid base for this project and few hardware that may expand this project. But i'm quite unsure if i will have have time. I'm quite more Sys Admin and like to programming. I hope IA will not remplace us all.

And the three.js team for creating such good 3D web tools.

(YES it's hilarious how i used their images while technically they do the same thing and really better, but i guess i have to show the thing at home. heheh. :3  )

Congrats myself for the release of first official version!

things to come futher:
- collision
- vr integration
- maybe possibility of going to planet (nothing really special, just clicks to planet and then 360° image (like old school resident evil?)
- easier coding and modularity? Idk if you need a tool for science fiction systems?..
- Refactor the code for the pity of future of myself or the forkers guys.
- Documentation ?
